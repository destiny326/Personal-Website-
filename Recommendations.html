  <h1>Horror Recommendations</h1>

<h3>Featured Picks</h3>

<p>Here are some horror films and series that left their mark — not because of jump scares, but because they linger long after the credits roll.  
These aren't ranked, just the ones that stayed in my head a little too long.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Eli</strong> (2019)</li>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qfSTiAw1rkM" title="Eli Trailer"></iframe>
  <p>A boy trapped in a sterile house under “treatment” for his illness — until he realizes the real sickness isn't in him. Twisted, claustrophobic, and cruelly clever.</p>

  <li><strong>The Haunting of Hill House</strong> (2018)</li>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxEEGi9V0kI" title="The Haunting of Hill House"></iframe>
  <p>Grief, trauma, and ghosts — all tangled into one heartbreaking story. Less about monsters and more about what haunts families forever.</p>

  <li><strong>The Woman in the Yard</strong> (2024)</li>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko4J3mWs" title="The Woman in the Yard"></iframe>
  <p>A slow-burn psychological thriller that turns domestic comfort into creeping paranoia. It's the kind of story that feels too real to shake off.</p>

  <li><strong>The Other Side of the Door</strong> (2016)</li>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMI6bGS97lk" title="The Other Side of the Door"></iframe>
  <p>Grief opens doors that should stay closed. A haunting take on loss and the price of not letting go — emotionally charged and genuinely eerie.</p>

  <li><strong>The Haunting of Bly Manor</strong> (2020)</li>
   <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/08ZYXHNbaOw" title="The Haunting of Bly Manor"></iframe>
  <p>A gothic love story disguised as a ghost story. Elegant, tragic, and full of emotional weight — a haunting that hurts in all the right ways.</p>
