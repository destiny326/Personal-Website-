      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Dessy's Space. This is my <strong>Nightmare Journal</strong> — a dark corner of the internet for anyone who loves horror, mystery, 
        and the art of fear. Here, we dig into films, stories, and strange true events that make your skin crawl.  
        It's not about jump scares — it's about what stays with you after the lights go out.

  <h2>Why I Started This Blog</h2>
  <p>
    I've always been fascinated by what scares us — the tension, the silence, the things we can't explain.  
    <strong>Dessy's Space</strong> is where I explore that obsession — peeling back the layers of fear, one story at a time.
